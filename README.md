# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction


The goal of this project was to analyze customer churn trends and predict potential churners using machine learning. By leveraging SQL, Python, and Power BI, I built a data pipeline that transforms raw data into meaningful insights, helping businesses proactively reduce churn.




Implementation

ETL Process: Extracted, cleaned, and transformed customer data using SQL.

Machine Learning: Developed a predictive model to identify at-risk customers.

Power BI Dashboards: Created interactive visualizations to track churn trends and customer behavior.




Actionable Insights to Reduce Churn
Overall Churn Rate (26.5%)
High churn indicates dissatisfaction and competitive pressure.
Action: Implement targeted retention offers and loyalty programs.

Churn by Contract Type (Month-to-Month: 46.5%)
Short-term contract users churn the most due to flexibility.
Action: Offer discounts and incentives for long-term contracts.

Churn by Internet Service (Fiber Optic: 41.1%)
Fiber Optic users have the highest churn, likely due to service or pricing concerns.
Action: Improve service reliability and introduce competitive pricing.

Churn by Region & Age Group
Higher churn among females, customers aged 30-35, and in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Action: Deploy region-specific marketing and improve localized support.

Predicted High-Risk Customers (378 Identified)
A segment of customers is at high risk of churning.
Action: Launch personalized retention campaigns and proactive outreach.

The dashboard allows filtering by various attributes and provides a data-driven approach to customer retention.
