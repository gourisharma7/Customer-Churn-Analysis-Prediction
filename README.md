# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction
Customer churn analysis and prediction using SQL, Python, and Power BI to identify at-risk customers and enhance retention strategies with data-driven insights.


About this project:

The goal of this project was to analyze customer churn trends and predict potential churners using machine learning. By leveraging SQL, Python, and Power BI, I built a data pipeline that transforms raw data into meaningful insights, helping businesses proactively reduce churn.




Implementation

ETL Process: Extracted, cleaned, and transformed customer data using SQL.

Machine Learning: Developed a predictive model to identify at-risk customers.

Power BI Dashboards: Created interactive visualizations to track churn trends and customer behavior.




Key Metrics in the Dashboard:

i) Total Customers, New Joiners, and Churn Rate

ii) Churn Breakdown by Demographics (Gender, Age, Contract Type, etc.)

iii) Service-based Churn Trends (Internet Type, Payment Method, etc.)

iv) Predicted High-Risk Customers for Proactive Retention Strategies


The dashboard allows filtering by various attributes and provides a data-driven approach to customer retention.
